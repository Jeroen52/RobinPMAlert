# RobinPMAlert
Messages all inactive people in your Reddit robin room

#### For [reddit's 2016 April Fools Day prank](https://www.reddit.com/robin/)

This script sends the following messages to offline users in your room:

```
The merge is about to happen! So, put on your browser and autovote (https://github.com/vartan/robin-grow) or just vote yourself now.  www.reddit.com/robin
```
You can customize the message to fit your room's merge schedule.

## Installation
Install a userscript extension such as greasemonkey or tampermonkey:  
Click here: http://tampermonkey.net


Then, click this link to install the script:  
https://github.com/fedorg/RobinPMAlert/raw/master/RPMA.user.js

After that, go to your messages:
https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/

The script should start automatically filling the forms and sending messages about the merge. The rate is around 1 message every 25 seconds.

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
